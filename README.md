# The International Data Spaces Association on GitHub
"The International Data Spaces Association is a coalition of over 180+ members who share a vision of a world where all companies and organizations can self-determine the usage rules of their data in secure, trusted and equal partnerships. Their goal is to establish a global standard for international data spaces (IDS) while fostering related technologies and business models for open, federated data ecosystems and marketplaces that ensure data sovereignty for all participants.

## What is Available Here?
This is an umbrella repository designed to guide you through the International Data Spaces Association (IDSA) on GitHub by directing you to the right sources of information. We provide a brief overview of the resources available in this repository and beyond to help you build data spaces and share data in a secure and sovereign way. You can also find an overview of the repositories [here](./overview_repositories.md). If you are interested in terms commonly used in the IDS ecosystem, check out the [IDS Glossary in IDS-G](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-G/tree/main/Glossary).

## :blue_book: IDS Reference Architecture Model (IDS RAM) <a name="IDS-RAM"></a>
The [IDS RAM](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/RAM5) is the beating heart of the IDS. It is **accessible to IDSA members** and includes the standards for secure and sovereign data exchange, certification and governance. The RAM serves as the blueprint for trusted ecosystems for data exchange and processing.

The continuous development of the IDS RAM takes place in its dedicated repository and -as always— is open to contributions. You are warmly invited to start contributing by checking the [contribution rules here](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/RAM5/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and/or [the list of existing issues](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/RAM5/issues).

You may also find the [previous version (v4.0) here](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-RAM_4_0) that is publicly archived.


## :green_book: IDSA Rulebook <a name="IDSA-RULEBOOK"></a>
In an era dominated by data-driven ecosystems and businesses, the development and operation of data spaces have become crucial for organizations seeking success and competitiveness. The IDSA Rulebook plays a pivotal role in this landscape, serving multiple purposes that are instrumental in shaping the data space framework. At its core, the IDSA Rulebook aims to provide a clear delineation between mandatory rules and optional guidelines, encompassing functional, technical, operational and legal dimensions. This governance framework lays down guidelines for common service functionalities, defining processes and outlining specific roles and services within data spaces. In short, the IDSA Rulebook stands as a comprehensive guide for navigating the complexities of data spaces, offering essential guidelines for data functionality, technical implementation, collaboration and legal compliance. Join us in contributing to the development and enhancement of the IDS Rulebook. Your expertise and insights can make a significant impact on creating guidelines that foster innovation, collaboration and compliance in data spaces.

You can access the [IDSA Rulebook repository here](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDSA-Rulebook).

You may also find the [rendered version here](https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/ids-knowledgebase/v/idsa-rulebook/front-matter/readme) in PDF format.


## ✔️IDS Reference Testbed <a name="IDS-Reference-Testbed"></a>
[IDS Testbed](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-testbed) is a setup with open-source IDS components. It can be used to verify if a component implements the IDS specifications for establishing connections and communication and thus, can work interoperable with all IDS components in the testbed setup. 

The IDS Testbed is the starting point for the creation of data spaces. It can be used for:
-	component behavior testing
-	interoperability testing against IDS components (Connector, DAPS, CA, Metadata Broker)
-	preparation for IDS Certification 

You can check the [IDS Reference Testbed repository](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-testbed) for more information.


## :book: Knowledge Base <a name="Knowledge-Base"></a>
The IDS Knowledge Base is a step-by-step guide on [How to Build Data Spaces](./how-to-build-data-spaces/README.md) on the foundation of IDS. This community-driven knowledge base is a place to gather and share information. New contributions are always very welcome. If you are interested in sharing your experiences with the community, please start with the [contribution guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

:triangular_flag_on_post: Part of the IDS Knowledge Base is also available on the IDSA website [docs.internationaldataspaces.org](https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/ids-knowledgebase) where you will find lean and brief information on the most popular topics about IDS technologies.
