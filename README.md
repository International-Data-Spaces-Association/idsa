The Knowledge Base is the store of information that relies on IDS expertise, that is meant to support building IDS components and contribute to the existing open source components. A five-step approach is depicted here to sort the great amount of information and documentation in a structured manner. Each step contains links to the relevant information and resources that might be helpful in the process of establishing data spaces.

In the chapter titled ["How to Build Data Spaces?"](https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/how-to-build-data-spaces/), readers can explore detailed guidance on leveraging the existing IDS assets and documentation to facilitate their journey in building data spaces. This chapter provides comprehensive insights and practical information for effectively utilizing the resources available in the IDS Knowledge Base towards the development of data spaces.
