# The International Data Spaces Association on GitHub

This is an umbrella repository which guides you through the International Data Spaces Association (IDSA). We briefly provide an overview on available resources in this repository and beyond. To support your journey building data spaces and maintaining data sovereignty while sharing data, we offer here a growing and community-driven knowledge base and an overview on available Open Source components, based on the IDSA Open Source Graduation Scheme.

## SHARING DATA WHILE KEEPING DATA OWNERSHIP

The International Data Spaces Association aims at open, federated data ecosystems and marketplaces ensuring data sovereignty for the creator of the data.

Today, there is a common understanding that data is of high value. Leveraging this value and trading data creates huge revenues for the large data platform providers. Rarely, the creators of data are benefitting from this value in an adequate way. Often, only the cost for data creation and management remain with them. Furthermore, many give their data away for free or pay with it for the use of a service. Finally, others keep it for themselves without taking advantage of the value.

There is a need for vendor independent data ecosystems and marketplaces, open to all at low cost and with low entry barriers. This need is addressed by the International Data Spaces (IDS) Association, a nonprofit organization with today about 100 members from various industrial and scientific domains. The IDS Association specified an architecture, interfaces and sample code for an open, secure data ecosystem of trusted partners.

The specification of the IDS Association forms the basis for a data marketplace based on European values, i.e. data privacy and security, equal opportunities through a federated design, and ensuring data sovereignty for the creator of the data and trust among participants. It forms the strategic link between the creation of data in the internet of things on the one hand side and the use of this data in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms on the other hand side.

As depicted on the infographic below, the IDS standard enables trustworthy data exchange among certified dataproviders and recipients, based on mutually agreed rules. Data spaces improve cooperation, lower the barriers to entry and enhance innovation for the future of data economy.

### IDS-G

The [IDS-G](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-G) is the point of truth for specifications of the IDS and its components. It is public for everyone and contains the approved specifications that were confirmed by the IDS Technical Steering Committee (IDS-TSC) and the IDSA Working Groups. IDS-G publishes quarterly releases with new approvals by the Working Groups and the TSC.

Find the overview on the IDS resources and status of specifications in [**IDS-G** here on GitHub](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-G)

You are invited to [create issues on IDS-G](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-G/issues). The issues are tracked, approved and worked on in [IDS-G-pre](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-G-pre) by IDSA members.

### Repository Overview

The International Data Spaces Association GitHub organization provides insights on the IDSA core deliverables and supports Open Source Projects. You can find an overview on the available repositories [here](./overview_repositories.md)

---

## Knowledge Base

The [Knowledge Base](./how-to-build-data-spaces/README.md) provides insights to support your way to build Data Spaces on the foundation of IDS. This community-driven knowledge base is a place to gather and share knowledge.
Find the technical documentation and learn about the steps to build data spaces in [How To Build Data Spaces](/how-to-build-data-spaces/README.md#building-data-spaces) page. IDS components or implement and/or contribute to the existing open source components. It will link you to relevant sources and will provide guidance on your way.

---

## Management of IDSA Releases

The IDS-RAM and specifications on IDS-G are governed and managed by the IDSA and its members through the bodies of the association. The main bodies are the IDSA Working Groups. Details on the management of IDSA releases are described in the [IDS-G Handbook](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-G/blob/main/Handbook/README.md)

---

## Installation

To get started with IDS based Data Spaces we provide an overview on available components in the Portfolio of Building Blocks (coming soon!) and setup examples based on the Minimum Viable Data Space (coming soon!).

## Willing to Contribute
You are warmly invited to contribute to the IDSA work. While some aspects of the IDSA work is limited to IDSA members, most of the work here on GitHub is open for everybody to use and to contribute. You can always create Change Request as Issue on IDS-G (https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-G). 

You can contribute your technology by following the IDSA OSS Gradaution Scheme as explained below.

Feel free to add your knowledge and experience to the IDSA Knowledge Base. 


### BECOME PART OF IDS OPEN SOURCE LANDSCAPE
IDSA welcomes contributions from all levels (organizational, individual and projects) to the IDS Open Source Landscape. Feel free to join, discover and be part of the projects that constitute the technical backbone of the data economy's future. You can check the list of [existing repositories here](/overview_repositories.md).

This will not only make you a part of the great community here, but also will give you an opportunity to share your experiences, express your opinion and gather feedback from the other members. So, as long as you have an idea on IDS components or data spaces in general please feel free to join us!

The IDSA Open Source Software Graduation Scheme is placed in in this repository. 
- Find the scheme itself [in the graduation scheme folder](./graduation_scheme/README.md).
