# Documentation
## Introduction
The following content is meant to support everyone who wants to either build IDS components or implement existing open source components.
It will link you to relevant sources and will provide guidance on your way. 

Since this documentation relies on the IDS expertise and experience of everyone involved, also **you are asked to contribute to it.** 
As soon as you notice that you are missing information at a certain point, you can:
+ Open an issue that points to this topic. 
+ Add a section, link, or whatever would fill this gap.
+ Have a look at the open issues and try to fix them.


Since every journey is individual, the starting point may differ as well as the steps you have to take. 
In general, your journey may contain the following stages: 
+ Gather knowledge
+ Design your architecture
+ Develop your components
+ Integrate your components
+ Prepare for certification
+ Get IDS certified
+ Register to get on board
+ Start sharing

### Use Open Source Software
[start with the data space connector](https://international-data-spaces-association.github.io/DataspaceConnector/)


## Gather knowledge
This stage is meant to sharpen your comprehension of IDS technologies and core ideas. It is linking you to every source that could be of help while learning about the IDS. (E.g. IDS Reference Architecture, IDS Rulebook, Current IDS standard, IDS Handshake and Communication Guide)

### GOALS OF THE INTERNATIONAL DATA SPACES
Data sovereignty is a central aspect of the International Data
Spaces. It can be defined as a natural person’s or corporate
entity’s capability of being entirely self-determined with regard
to its data. The International Data Spaces initiative proposes
a Reference Architecture Model for this particular capability
and related aspects, including requirements for secure
and trusted data exchange in business ecosystems.

+ **TRUST:** Trust is the basis of the International Data Spaces. Each participant is evaluated and certified before being granted access to the trusted business ecosystem.

+ **SECURITY AND DATA SOVEREIGNTY:** All components of the International Data Spaces rely on state-of-the-art security measures. Apart from architectural specifications, security is mainly ensured by the evaluation and certification of each technical component used in the International Data Spaces. In line with the central aspect of ensuring data sovereignty, a data owner in the International Data Spaces attaches usage restriction information to their data before it is transferred to a data consumer. To use the data, the data consumer must fully accept the data owner’s usage policy.

+ **ECOSYSTEM OF DATA:** The architecture of the International
                         Data Spaces does not require central data storage capabilities.
                         Instead, it pursues the idea of decentralization
                         of data storage, which means that data physically remains
                         with the respective data owner until it is transferred to a
                         trusted party. This approach requires a comprehensive description
                         of each data source and the value and usability
                         of data for other companies, combined with the ability to
                         integrate domain-specific data vocabularies. In addition,
                         brokers in the ecosystem provide services for real-time
                         data search.

+ **STANDARDIZED INTEROPERABILITY:** The International
                                     Data Spaces Connector, being a central component of the
                                     architecture, is implemented in different variants and can
                                     be acquired from different vendors. Nevertheless, each
                                     Connector is able to communicate with any other Connector
                                     (or other technical component) in the ecosystem of the
                                     International Data Space.

+ **VALUE ADDING APPS:** The International Data Spaces allows
                         to inject apps into the IDS Connectors in order to
                         provide services on top of data exchange processes. This
                         includes services for data processing, data format alignment,
                         and data exchange protocols, for example. Furthermore,
                         data analytics services can be provided by remote
                         execution of algorithms.

+ **DATA MARKETS:** The International Data Space enables the
                    creation of novel, data-driven services that make use of
                    data apps. It also fosters new business models for these
                    services by providing clearing mechanisms and billing
                    functions, and by creating domain-specific broker solutions
                    and marketplaces. In addition, the International Data
                    Spaces provides templates and other methodological support
                    for participants to use when specifying usage restriction
                    information and requesting legal information.

All research and development activities, as well as all activities
with regard to standardization, are driven by the
following guidelines:


+ **OPEN DEVELOPMENT PROCESS:** The International Data
                                Spaces Association is a non-profit organization institutionalized
                                under the German law of associations. Every organization
                                is invited to participate, as long as it adheres to the
                                common principles of work.

+ **RE-USE OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES:** Inter-organizational
                                       information systems, data interoperability, and information
                                       security are well-established fields of research and
                                       development, with plenty of technologies available in the
                                       market. The work of the International Data Spaces initiative
                                       is guided by the idea not to “reinvent the wheel”, but to
                                       use existing technologies (e.g., from the open-source domain)
                                       and standards (e.g., semantic standards of the W3C)
                                       to the extent possible.

+ **CONTRIBUTION TO STANDARDIZATION:** Aiming at establishing
                                       an international standard itself, the International
                                       Data Spaces initiative supports the idea of standardized architecture
                                       stacks.
                                       

### International Data Spaces Association
**TODO**: Describe IDSA, Goals, Link to "Become Member"

### How to start
Currently, IDS does not yet have an overarching existing ecosystem. Until now, mainly use cases between individual companies have been addressed
In the following diagram, these are located in evolutionary stage **I**.
In the meantime, use cases of evolution stage **II** are becoming increasingly established. The [Mobility Data Space](https://www.mobility-data-space.de/) and [Catena-X](https://www.handelsblatt.com/27129464.html) are particularly worthy of mention here, as are other [IDS Communities](https://internationaldataspaces.org/make/communities/) and [Projects](https://internationaldataspaces.org/make/projects/).
