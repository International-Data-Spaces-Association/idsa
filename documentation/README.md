# Documentation
## Introduction
The following content is meant to support everyone who wants to build IDS components. 
It will link you to relevant sources and will provide guidance on your way. 
Since every journey is individual, the starting point may differ as well as the steps you have to take. 
In general, your journey may contain the following stages: 
+ Gather knowledge
+ Design your architecture
+ Develop your components
+ Integrate your components
+ Prepare for certification
+ Get IDS certified
+ Register to get on board
+ Start sharing
## Gather knowledge
This stage is meant to sharpen your comprehension of IDS technologies and core ideas. It is linking you to every source that could be of help while learning about the IDS. (E.g. IDS Reference Architecture, IDS Rulebook, Current IDS standard, IDS Handshake and Communication Guide)

**IDS Reference Architecture Model (RAM)** – This is an introductory document to the IDS architecture. It describes the goals, the structure, and the key elements of the architectural set-up of the IDS and offers a first glance at the practical application and context in which the IDS is used. Link to the document: https://internationaldataspaces.org/wp-content/uploads/IDS-Reference-Architecture-Model-3.0-2019.pdf

**Visual Overview of the IDS** – Here you can find a visual representation of the IDS architecture that helps you and your business to understand the basic setup of the IDS. Link to the document: https://internationaldataspaces.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/IDSA-Infografik-English.pdf

**IDS Standard (DIN SPEC 27070)** – The DIN SPEC 27070 is a confidential document that specifies the technical requirements and the reference architecture of a Security Gateway for the exchange of industry data and services. Based on the principles of data sovereignty, the Security Gateway facilitates secure exchange of data and allows providing and using trustworthy data services. Link to request access to the document: https://internationaldataspaces.org/din-spec-27070/

**IDS and GAIA-X Position Paper** – The European initiative GAIA-X and the International Data Spaces share the vision of proliferating data sovereignty in a trusted data ecosystem. Nevertheless, some main differences exist. This position paper explains the relation of the International Data Spaces Reference Architecture Model and the principles and architecture of the European Imitative GAIA-X. Link to the document: https://internationaldataspaces.org/wp-content/uploads/IDSA-Position-Paper-GAIA-X-and-IDS.pdf

**IDSA Rulebook** – This document is meant for businesses and individuals who are building or using data-driven business models. This rulebook outlines a common governance framework and specifies the functional, technical, operational, and legal agreements to operate securely in the IDS. Link to the document: https://internationaldataspaces.org/wp-content/uploads/IDSA-White-Paper-IDSA-Rule-Book.pdf

**IDS Glossary** – In this glossary, the most important terms of the IDS, the services, and tools are defined (e.g., Clearing House, Data Provider, Data Sovereignty). Link to the glossary: https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-G/blob/master/glossary/README.md#certification-authority

**IDS Use Case Overview** – The purpose of this document is to provide interested parties with an overview of the practical application of the IDS architecture in various industries. The use cases which are gathered in this document are real-life examples of IDS industry partners and include a short problem statement, description of the targets, results, and benefits. Link to the document: https://internationaldataspaces.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/Use-Case-Brochure_2019.pdf

**New Business Models for Data Spaces Grounded in Data Sovereignty** - This paper applies business frameworks and methods to the IDS perspective and gives some concrete use-case examples of early adopters for governance, participants, and support service providers. Link to the document: https://internationaldataspaces.org/wp-content/uploads/IDSA-Position-Paper-New-Business-Models-sneak-preview-version.pdf

**IDS Handshake** – This document, referred to as the IDS Handshake, details the actual steps of the data exchange process between participants in the IDS. It highlights the mandatory and optional steps that are needed to establish a trustworthy connection. To access this document, you must be registered in JIVE under https://internationaldataspaces.org/we/get-access-to-jive/. Link to the document: https://industrialdataspace.jiveon.com/docs/DOC-1817#jive_content_id_Motivation

**IDS Communication Guide** – This document describes how the interfaces of the individual components are defined and, above all, implemented. This results in a very precise description of the interfaces of individual components. To access this document, you must be registered in JIVE under https://internationaldataspaces.org/we/get-access-to-jive/. Link to the document: https://industrialdataspace.jiveon.com/docs/DOC-2524


## Design your architecture
This stage is meant to support you in designing the architecture of your components. It provides relevant links and explains the context around it. 
## Develop your components
You can either build IDS components from scratch by using existing resources as a template, or you can reuse existing open source components available on the [IDS Git-Hub repository](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association). Already at this stage, you must ensure that the necessary requirements for a later, successful certification are met.
+ IDS Connector Architecture 
+ Metadata Broker
+ Infomodel
+ Identity Management (DAPS, ParIS, CA)
+ App Store
+ Vocabulary Provider
+ Clearing House
## Integrate your components
+ Integration of IDS into existing systems
## Prepare for certification
+ IDS Plugfest 
+ IDS Testbeds 
+ SQS Integration Test Camp
+ IDS Lab 
+ Sick testbed
+ nicos AG testbed 
+ Fraunhofer workshop IDS_ready
## Get IDS certified
Once you have chosen your preferred evaluation facility, you can start to get your components and operational environemnt certified. Here, you will find relevant information on how to start the process. 
## Register to get on board
You will need to gather all necessary documents and provide them to the on-boarding facility, which will introduce you to the targeted data space. 
## Start sharing
Here, you will get hints on how to set for instance usage contrains.
