# Documentation
## Introduction
The following content is meant to support everyone who wants to build IDS components. 
It will link you to relevant sources and will provide guidance on your way. 
Since every journey is individual, the starting point may differ as well as the steps you have to take. 
In general, your journey may contain the following stages: 
+ Gather knowledge
+ Design your architecture
+ Develop your components
+ Integrate your components
+ Prepare for certification
+ Get IDS certified
+ Register to get on board
+ Start sharing
## Gather knowledge
This stage is meant to sharpen your comprehension of IDS technologies and core ideas. It is linking you to every source that could be of help while learning about the IDS. (E.g. IDS Reference Architecture, IDS Rulebook, Current IDS standard, IDS Handshake and Communication Guide)
## Design your architecture
This stage is meant to support you in designing the architecture of your components. It provides relevant links and explains the context around it. 
## Develop your components
You can either build IDS components from scratch by using existing resources as a template, or you can reuse existing open source components available on the [IDS Git-Hub repository](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association). Already at this stage, you must ensure that the necessary requirements for a later, successful certification are met.

## Integrate your components
+ Integration of IDS into existing systems
## Prepare for certification
+ IDS Plugfest 
+ IDS Testbeds 
+ SQS Integration Test Camp
+ IDS Lab 
+ Sick testbed
+ nicos AG testbed

## Get IDS certified
Once you have chosen your preferred evaluation facility, you can start to get your components and operational environemnt certified. Here, you will find relevant information on how to start the process. 
## Register to get on board
You will need to gather all necessary documents and provide them to the on-boarding facility, which will introduce you to the targeted data space. 
## Start sharing
Here, you will get hints on how to set for instance usage contrains.
