# How to contribute to [the IDS documentation](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/blob/documentation-IDS/documentation/README.md)
## Introduction
Dear IDS supporter, thank you for considering contributing to ["the IDS documentation"](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/blob/documentation-IDS/documentation/README.md). It is your active particiaption and your specific knowledge that we are looking for.

The IDS documentation is meant as a lean guide that leads developers through their way to develop or implement IDS components. 
It is meant as a compilation of important resources and links, linked by concise but brief explanations provided by IDS experts (such as you?).
You can contribute in many ways. For example, you might: 
- Add content to already existing sections
- Improve eisting content
- Extend the exiting topics with additional ones
- tbc.
## Ground Rules
No long stories are needed for the documentation. Only relevant links to helpful resources or material are the aim of this documentation, enriched with some background information, explaining, why you are doing what step while creating IDS components. 

Please consider the following rules:
- keep it as short and simple as possible
- provide links to respective sources when possible, instead of reproducing content form other pages
- provide background information (one or two sentences) when adding links
- create issues when something is misisng (or wrong) in your opinion
- tbc.
