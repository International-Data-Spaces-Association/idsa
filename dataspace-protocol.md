# Dataspace Protocol

The Dataspace Protocol is a comprehensive set of specifications designed to facilitate secure, trustworthy, and interoperable data sharing between entities using web technologies and governed by usage control. These specifications define the required schemas, protocols, and interfaces that allow entities to publish data, negotiate usage agreements, and access data within a federation of technical systems known as a data space. By leveraging the Dataspace Protocol, organizations can ensure that their data sharing practices comply with industry standards and best practices, while also enabling new data-driven business models and opportunities.
