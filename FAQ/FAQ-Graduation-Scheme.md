# What is the IDS Graduation Scheme?
The [IDS Graduation Scheme](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/tree/main/graduation_scheme) is an assessment methodology used by the International Data Spaces Association (IDSA) to evaluate the technical maturity of 
open-source IDS component implementations and group them into three levels: Sandbox, Incubated, and Graduated.

---

# How can I apply to the IDS Graduation Scheme?
To apply to the IDS Graduation Scheme, you can submit your project for evaluation using the 
[application forms](https://internationaldataspaces.org/open-source-application-form/) available via the IDSA website. 

---

# What is the purpose of the IDS Graduation Scheme?
The IDS Graduation Scheme aims to increase the visibility of technically mature IDS component implementations among the IDSA network and provide a transparent way to showcase available Building Blocks. It also encourages contributions to open-source IDS components and fosters interoperability and innovation in the data sovereignty domain.

---

# How can I contribute to the IDS Graduation Scheme?
You can contribute to IDS Graduation Scheme by [creating an issue](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa) on IDSA GitHub repository.

---

# What is the Sandbox stage in the IDS Graduation Scheme?
The Sandbox stage is the initial stage of the IDS Graduation Scheme where projects submit their proposals to join the International Data Spaces Association (IDSA). 
Projects at this stage align with the IDSA mission, provide value to the IDSA, and have a public roadmap, among other criteria.

---

# What is expected from projects in the Sandbox stage?
Projects in the Sandbox stage are expected to align with the IDSA mission, provide value to the IDSA, have a public roadmap, adhere to IDSA legal and IP policy requirements, 
and align with existing IDSA projects. These projects should work towards meeting the criteria for the Incubating stage. 

---

# How can I apply to the Sandbox level of IDS Graduation Scheme?
You can do it via the [form on IDSA Website](https://internationaldataspaces.org/sandbox-application/). 
A one-page guide is also available [here](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/blob/main/graduation_scheme/IDSA-Sandbox-Application.pdf).

---

# What is the Incubating stage in the IDS Graduation Scheme?
The Incubating stage is the intermediate stage in the IDS Graduation Scheme where projects that have proven their compatibility, reliability, vision, 
and mission, based on IDS Certification, are placed. These projects are expected to continue to mature and work towards broader acceptance and adoption.

---

# What is expected from projects in the Incubating stage?
Projects in the Incubating stage are expected to continue to mature and prove their compatibility, reliability, vision, and mission based on IDS Certification. 
They should work towards broader acceptance and adoption, actively engage with the IDSA community, and contribute to the IDSA goals. 

---

# What is the Graduating stage in the IDS Graduation Scheme?
The Graduating stage is the highest level of maturity in the IDS Graduation Scheme. Projects at this stage have achieved broad acceptance and adoption in data spaces and signal the success of an IDSA project. 
These projects have demonstrated a high level of technical maturity and adherence to IDSA standards.

---

# What is expected from projects in the Graduating stage?
Projects in the Graduating stage are expected to have achieved broad acceptance and adoption in data spaces. 
They should have a high level of technical maturity, adhere to IDSA standards, and continue to actively contribute to the IDSA community. 
These projects serve as examples of successful IDSA projects. 

---

# Where can I see a list of projects that are part of IDS Graduation Scheme? 
You can find them on [this page](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/blob/main/graduation_scheme/Projects.md). 

---

# Who reviews the applications? 
IDSA's Technical Steering Committee (TSC) reviews all applications to the IDS Graduation Scheme.

---

# What are the benefits of participating in the IDS Graduation Scheme?
Participating in the IDS Graduation Scheme offers several benefits, including the opportunity to align with the IDSA mission, receive support from IDSA Head Office 
and members, gain recognition for contributions, and establish a track record of success in the IDSA ecosystem. Graduated projects also signal the highest 
level of maturity and acceptance in data spaces.

---

# How often are projects reviewed in the IDS Graduation Scheme?
Projects in the IDS Graduation Scheme are reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) for acceptance, progress, 
and alignment with IDSA goals. Projects are evaluated based on their roadmap, governance, vendor-neutrality, and overall contribution to the 
IDSA ecosystem.

---
# What type of projects can apply to IDS Graduation Scheme? Should it be a component or a set of components? 
The term "project" refers to both a single component or a set of components. So it is possible for a project (that is applicant of IDS Graduation Scheme) 
to be consisting of a standalone component or multiple components. 


---
# What is the relationship between IDS Certification and IDS Graduation Scheme? 
IDS Certification serves as a crucial element to prove the project's compliance with the International Data Spaces (IDS) standards and principles and 
is required for projects in the Incubation stage of the IDS Graduation Scheme. 

---
# How long does a project typically stay in the Sandbox stage of the IDS Graduation Scheme? 
The duration of a project in the Sandbox stage can vary depending on its progress and readiness for graduation. Typically, projects may stay in the Sandbox 
stage for several months to a year or more. The duration may depend on various factors, including the complexity of the project, the level of community 
engagement, and the pace of development. Projects are encouraged to actively engage with the IDS community, address feedback, and make progress towards 
meeting the graduation criteria to move to the next stage.

------
# How long does the review process for a Sandbox application typically take?
The review process for a Sandbox application is conducted by the IDSA's Technical Steering Committee (TSC) and typically lasts several weeks. 
However, it's important to note that the TSC holds meetings on a monthly basis, which may affect the overall duration of the review process. 
The actual timeline may vary depending on factors such as the volume of applications and the complexity of the project being reviewed.
It's recommended for applicants to plan accordingly and allow sufficient time for the review process to be completed. 
Applicants should also ensure that they have submitted all the required information and documentation as per the application guidelines provided 
by the IDSA to avoid any delays in the review process. The IDSA aims to provide a thorough and comprehensive review to ensure the quality and 
compliance of projects in the IDS ecosystem.

------
# How can projects express their qualification level in the IDS Graduation Scheme once they successfully qualify at any stage?
Projects that have successfully qualified at any stage of the IDS Graduation Scheme, including Sandbox, Incubated, or Graduated, can express their 
qualification level by using the respective IDS Graduation Scheme logo. These logos can be found on the 
[IDSA's GitHub repository](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/tree/main/graduation_scheme/media). By including the 
appropriate logo in their project materials, websites, or communications, projects can visually indicate their qualification level and showcase 
their compliance with the IDS Graduation Scheme standards. It's important to ensure that the usage of these logos follows the IDSA's communication 
guidelines, which are available via [here](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/blob/main/graduation_scheme/resources/IDSA-OSS-CommunicationGuidelines.pdf), 
to ensure consistent and compliant representation of their qualification level.
