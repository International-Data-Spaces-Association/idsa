# What is the IDS Knowledge Base?
The IDS Knowledge Base was created to simplify the learning experience and provide a structured, easy-to-follow guide for building data spaces or components. 
There, you'll find all the information you need to build data spaces, whether you're just starting or have some experience.

# Who is the guide for?
This guide is intended for anyone interested in building dataspace components or using existing ones to build dataspaces. The guide offers links and references 
for more in-depth learning, making it easy to find what you're looking for, whether you're new to the world of data spaces or an experienced professional.

# How is the information in the guide divided?
The information in the Knowledge base is divided into the five general stages of building dataspaces:

1. Gather Knowledge - Get a better understanding of IDS core ideas and identify whether your company needs an IDS solution or aspires to support others in creating dataspaces.
2. Define your use case - Transform your business need into an IDS-based data sharing use case and collaborate with others to co-create or get support in your journey.
3. Build Components - Identify the specific components required for your use case, and get support on implementing existing suitable components or creating and developing your own.
4. Prepare for Go Live - Go through IDS certification and finalize the preparation of your components for establishing a dataspace.
5. Share - Go live and reap the benefits of secure and sovereign data sharing!
