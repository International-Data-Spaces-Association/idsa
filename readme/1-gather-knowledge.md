**IDS Use Case Overview** – The purpose of this document is to provide interested parties with an overview of the practical application of the IDS architecture in various industries. The use cases which are gathered in this document are real-life examples of IDS industry partners and include a short problem statement, description of the targets, results, and benefits. You can find the [latest version of the brochure (2022) here](https://internationaldataspaces.org/wp-content/uploads/220513\_Use-Case-Brochure.pdf) and also check the ones from previous years [via this page](https://internationaldataspaces.org/publications/most-important-documents/).

**New Business Models for Data Spaces Grounded in Data Sovereignty** - This paper applies business frameworks and methods to the IDS perspective and gives some concrete use-case examples of early adopters for governance, participants, and support service providers.
