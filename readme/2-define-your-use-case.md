# Step 2. Define Your Use Case

## 2. Define Your Use Case

### What is the importance of defining your use case? Why do we need data spaces?

IDS use cases show how our research applies to real life. They are examples and success stories that show what one can achieve by putting theory into practice. Therefore, defining your use case is important, since it provides the blueprints to build your success story on, and helps you realize the possible outcomes, needs, stakeholders that might come into play and requirements and needs that may be encountered.

Not just this, but most importantly, defining your use case shows the clear goal you are going for and provides other players with an example or how to apply these tools. We need data spaces, since they are the field where the players that make these use cases happen come together. Data spaces are the incubators for use cases and success stories.

This section aims to support you in defining the use case of your components. For this, some relevant links and resources are provided below:

**IDS Reference Architecture Model (RAM)** – This is an introductory document to the IDS architecture. It describes the goals, the structure, and the key elements of the architectural set-up of the IDS and offers a first glance at the practical application and context in which the IDS is used. [Learn more](https://github.com/anilturkmayali/idsa/blob/main/IDS-Reference-Architecture-Model-3.0-2019.pdf)

**IDS Communication Guide** – This document describes how the interfaces of the individual components are defined and, above all, implemented. This results in a very precise description of the interfaces of individual components. To access this document, you must be registered in JIVE under https://internationaldataspaces.org/we/get-access-to-jive/. [Access the document](https://industrialdataspace.jiveon.com/docs/DOC-2524)

**IDS Message Description** - This document lists all IDS message types along with a descripton of the role of each message type. The messages are categorized in the three main IDS message categories: Request, Response, and Notification messages.

**IDS Handshake** – This document, referred to as the IDS Handshake, details the actual steps of the data exchange process between participants in the IDS. It highlights the mandatory and optional steps that are needed to establish a trustworthy connection.

### How is the Data Spaces Radar linked to best practices?

How is the Data Spaces Radar linked to best practices? Simple: it is the place where you can find the most important data spaces. This means, success stories. This means, best practices.

The Data Spaces Radar makes data spaces happen by bringing all projects into the same place, engaging their adoption, identifying lighthouses, and helping the most promising ones. Projects here come from different domains and can vary in levels of maturity. Most mature data spaces are always good examples of best practices that can inspire new projects to come.
