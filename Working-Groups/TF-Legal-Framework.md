## Task Force Legal Framework (Open for all contributors)
**Description:** 
Legal aspects are crucial in ensuring innovation and safeguarding sovereignty within data spaces. The Task Force Legal has been established by IDSA to discuss and align legal issues with other initiatives, strengthening IDSA’s internal and external positioning on legal matters.

The Task Force Legal has two areas of activity: public voice and tasks and solutions. Public voice involves external communication with stakeholders, providing input to regulatory proposals and proactive impulses on legal issues. Tasks and solutions support working groups and projects, finding answers to general regulatory questions and specific contractual issues.
