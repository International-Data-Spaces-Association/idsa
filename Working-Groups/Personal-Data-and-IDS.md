## Personal Data and IDS Sub Working Group
**Description:** 
In today's data-driven world, the exchange of personal data is becoming increasingly prevalent. As technology advances and new standards like IDS emerge, it is vital to ensure that individual rights and privacy are adequately safeguarded. Our primary purpose is to define the existing mechanisms through which IDS handles situations involving personal data and to envision how it should evolve to be more user-centric.

This sub working group is positioned under Working Group Architecture of IDSA and is for IDSA members. We invite you to collaborate with us in this crucial endeavor as we explore the frontiers of personal data and its potential interactions with the ever-evolving landscape of IDS.


### Activities
The core of our mission is to delve deep into how the IDS standard currently incorporates personal data considerations. We aim to identify any limitations or gaps that may hinder the seamless integration of personal data within IDS. Through collaborative efforts and insightful research, we aspire to propose practical and inclusive solutions to bridge these gaps effectively.

We aim to:
- Explore and understand the intersection between the International Data Spaces (IDS) standard and personal data sharing.

- Define how IDS currently does and should handle situations where individuals have a role. How IDS standard should work with user-centricity. What is currently missing and how we can address these gaps in order to enhance the effectiveness and inclusivity of the IDS standard for personal data.

- To gain a deeper understanding of how IDS incorporates personal data considerations, identify any existing limitations, and propose practical solutions to bridge these gaps.

- Investigate how to ensure interoperability by applying technologies (such as MyData, IDS, Solid) from personal data perspective

- Discover how personal data intermediary role could be positioned within IDS by putting individual to the center of the data sharing process.
