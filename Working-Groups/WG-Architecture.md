## Working Group Architecture
The IDSA Architecture Working Group defines and promotes architectural principles and implementation patterns that are firmly grounded in the IDSA core concepts as described in the IDSA Rulebook. Its mission is to guide architects and software engineers in designing and developing trusted, interoperable, and compliant dataspaces.

Through a combination of best practices, reference blueprints, and trade-off analyses, the group supports the design of robust dataspace solutions while highlighting known anti-patterns to avoid. It also explores and discusses the essential technical capabilities that dataspaces enable—such as data discovery, policy enforcement, usage control, identity resolution, and observability—and provides in-depth analysis of how these can be implemented in a compliant manner.

Maintaining a technology-neutral perspective, the Architecture Working Group focuses on aligning diverse implementations with the shared IDSA vision. By contributing deep technical expertise to the broader IDSA community, the group plays a key role in shaping discussions around emerging trends and technologies that advance the future of data sharing ecosystems.
