# IDS RAM 4 #

Please find the [IDS Reference Architecture Model Version 4 here](https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/ids-ram-4/).

The IDS RAM is complemented with additional documents and repositories. Most relevant in this context is the [IDS-G](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-G). In general, the IDS RAM contains the conceptual level including technology-agnostic specifications. The general outline of the IDS RAM is based on the five layers and the three perspectives. Each layer should reflect the main components and aspects of the IDS.

The IDS-G contains specific details on specifications, e.g. APIs and their descriptions.
