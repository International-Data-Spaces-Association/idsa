The IDS RAM is complemented with additional documents and repositories. Most relevant in this context is the IDS-G (including IDS-G-pre). In general, the IDS RAM contains the conceptual level including technology-agnostic specifications. The general outline of the IDS RAM is based on the five layers and the three perspectives. Each layer should reflect the main components and aspects of the IDS.

The IDS-G contains specific details on specifications, e.g. APIs and their descriptions.

The IDS RAM 4.0 will be created as an online document and does not target a printed document, at first. This enables the use of linking contents more easily, e.g. creating references to the IDS-G. After that, a printable White Paper of the IDS RAM should be generated from this repository. There, the main outline of the concepts shall be described.
