# 3. Build Components
When building components for a dataspace, the three main paths to follow are:

:one: You can initiate a custom implementation by using the available open-source components on [IDS Github](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/blob/main/overview_repositories.md). This option allows for greater flexibility and customization based on the purpose of the implementation.

:two: Alternatively, you can use [IDS Reference Testbed as a Minimum Viable Data Space](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-testbed/blob/master/minimum-viable-data-space/MVDS.md) which consists of just enough features to create a working dataspace with secure and sovereign data exchange. 

:three: [IDS-Basecamp](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-BaseCamp) can be used as a more mature industry-grade solution.

In all three options, [IDS Graduation Scheme](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/blob/main/graduation_scheme/Projects.md) and [Data Connector Report](https://internationaldataspaces.org/data-connector-report/) can be helpful resources to support the implementation process of dataspaces. 

The [Data Connector Report](https://internationaldataspaces.org/data-connector-report/) provides an overview of available connectors in the market, including open-source options, while the [IDS Graduation Scheme](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/blob/main/graduation_scheme/Projects.md) showcases projects that are aligned with a clear path towards IDS-compliancy and are at a more mature stage of development. These resources can help organizations choose the right components and ensure that their implementation is secure and trustworthy.

Also to be compliant with IDS standard, one should always check and try to comply with the specifications listed on [IDS-G repository](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-G) and in the [specifications/criteria catalogues of IDS components](https://internationaldataspaces.org/publications/white-papers/) that are available via IDSA website.

4️⃣ A fourth path to implementing a dataspace is to partner with a technical implementation partner who can provide guidance and support throughout the process. With the help of an experienced IDS technical implementation partner, organizations can ensure that their data space implementation meets their unique needs and is aligned with industry standards and best practices. You can see a list of available [IDS Technical Implementation Partners](https://internationaldataspaces.org/adopt/implementation-partners/) on the IDSA website.


### Additional Content that can support your Journey



----- old content -----
You can either build IDS components from scratch by using existing resources as a template, or you can reuse existing open source components available on the IDS Github repository. Already at this stage, you must ensure that the necessary requirements for a later, successful certification are met. Below you can check the existing projects that are available on IDS OS Landscape. If you are looking for external support for the implementation process, you can check the section about [Technology Implementation Partners](#technology-implementation-partners), at the end of this page.

**Deployment Scenarios**, (*which is currently under development*) aims to consist the library of information, listing different deployment alternatives applied by IDS projects. When completed, this will be a source of inspiration and will provide technical guidance for others who would like to experiment with data spaces. This will be the place for all who is in search for best practices or exemplary deployment alternatives provided by domain experts, or those who are looking to share and improve their deployment scenarios.
