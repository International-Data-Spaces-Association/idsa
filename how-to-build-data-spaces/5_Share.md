When it comes to data sharing, usage control plays a critical role in data sharing within an International Data Spaces (IDS) ecosystem. The IDS is a network of distributed data sharing systems that enables secure and trustworthy exchange of data among organizations, including those in different countries. However, with the growing volume and complexity of data, it becomes necessary to ensure that only authorized individuals and organizations can access and use the data. Usage control allows organizations to specify the conditions under which data can be accessed, processed, and shared. This includes enforcing policies that govern access rights, data usage, and data retention. By implementing usage control mechanisms, organizations can ensure that data is used in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, minimize the risk of data misuse, and maintain trust among all stakeholders in the IDS ecosystem.

:arrow_forward: **Usage control in the IDS**
This document (Data Sovereignty: Updated Position Paper on Data Usage Control in the IDS) provides necessary information about how Data Usage Control is considered in IDS. [Link to the document](https://internationaldataspaces.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/IDSA-Position-Paper-Usage-Control-in-the-IDS-V3..pdf)

The Usage Control related applications are listed as follows:
- **MYDATA Control Technologies** MYDATA Control Technologies is a technical implementation of data sovereignty, which represents an essential component for informational self-determination. It is based on the IND2UCE framework for data usage control developed at Fraunhofer IESE. MYDATA Control Technologies implements data sovereignty by monitoring or intercepting security-relevant data flows. [MYDATA](https://www.mydata-control.de/)

## Data sharing contracts
In addition to usage control, data sharing contracts are also critical for ensuring secure and trustworthy data exchange in the IDS ecosystem. These contracts outline the terms and conditions for data sharing, including the rights and obligations of the parties involved, as well as the purpose and scope of data sharing. [The SITRA Rulebook](https://www.sitra.fi/en/publications/rulebook-for-a-fair-data-economy/)'s contract templates provide a useful framework for creating such contracts, as they are tailored to the specific needs and requirements of the IDS ecosystem. However, as the IDS evolves and new use cases emerge, it is important to continually update and refine these templates to ensure they remain relevant and effective. As part of this effort, the [Task Force Legal Framework](https://internationaldataspaces.org/make/working-groups/) of IDSA is working on adapting these contract templates into the IDS Rulebook, which will provide a standardized and legally compliant framework for data sharing within the IDS ecosystem. This will help to streamline the data sharing process, reduce legal and regulatory risks, and promote greater trust and collaboration among all stakeholders.

## Sharing best practices: Inspiring others in IDS deployment
As the final step of the data space deployment journey within the International Data Spaces (IDS) ecosystem, it is not only essential to ensure secure and trustworthy data sharing but also crucial to share our experiences with others. By sharing our implementation methods, you can inspire and guide fellow organizations to embark on their own IDS deployment journeys. There are two effective channels through which we can accomplish this goal.

Firstly, you can contribute to [IDS Deployment Scenarios](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-Deployment-Scenarios), the repository where IDS implementors and experts come together to exchange their footsteps related to IDS deployment. By sharing the details of our own successful implementation, you can provide valuable guidance and inspiration to those who are planning to embark on similar endeavors. 

Furthermore, we can take advantage of the [IDS Graduation Scheme](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/tree/main/graduation_scheme), to assess the maturity level of IDS projects and provide them with greater visibility. By sharing the process and outcomes of our deployment through this scheme, you not only gain recognition for our achievements but also contribute to the collective growth of the IDS ecosystem. This increased visibility allows everyone to connect with other organizations, build partnerships, and foster innovation through collaboration.
