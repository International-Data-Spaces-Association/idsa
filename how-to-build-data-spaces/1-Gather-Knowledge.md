# 1. Gather Knowledge
The first step towards building a data space is to gather knowledge about IDS core ideas and concepts. 
This stage is all about expanding your understanding of IDS technologies and core concepts. It is important to leverage every source of information that can help you learn more about the IDS. Once you have a better understanding of IDS, you can start defining your use case and identifying the specific components needed for your solution.

:point_right: If you are completely new to Data Spaces, we recommend [starting from the basics](#basics), to sharpen your understanding of IDS technologies and core ideas. This will link you to every source that could be of help while learning about the IDS.
If you're already familiar with the concept of Dataspaces, [feel free to skip below](#advanced) to the more advanced and in-depth reading materials.

:point_right: If you already have a dataspace implemented and want to learn more about what IDSA can offer, start from [Step 4](how-to-build-data-spaces/4-Prepare-for-Go-Live.md) of the five-step approach which involves preparing for go-live.

## What are Dataspaces? How IDSA defines a Dataspace?
A Dataspace is a secure and standardized digital infrastructure that enables trusted data exchange and data-based services among various stakeholders. In the IDS definition, a Dataspace is a virtual space that provides a standardized framework for data exchange, based on common protocols and formats, as well as secure and trusted data sharing mechanisms. The IDS Dataspace is designed to support data sovereignty, meaning that data owners retain control over their data and can determine who can use it and under what conditions. This is called Data Sovereignty.

The IDS Dataspace is intended to support a wide range of applications and industries. The Dataspace is designed to be interoperable with other Dataspaces, enabling seamless data exchange across different domains and industries. Overall, the IDS Dataspace is a flexible and scalable domain and technology-agnostic framework that enables secure and trusted data exchange and services, while preserving data sovereignty and privacy.

:arrow_forward:**IDS Reference Architecture Model (IDS RAM)**

[The IDS RAM](https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/ids-ram-4/) is the beating heart of the IDS. It includes the standards for secure and sovereign data exchange, certification, and governance. The RAM serves as the blueprint for trusted ecosystems for data exchange and processing.

Since the release of v4.0, the IDS RAM is available as a Gitbook page and also has a repository on [IDS Github](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-RAM_4_0) to raise issues and contribute to it.


:arrow_forward:**IDS Rulebook**

The [IDSA rulebook](https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/idsa-rulebook-v2/) serves several purposes regarding the development and operation of data spaces. The aim is to describe clearly which rules are mandatory and which are optional guidelines. This governance framework includes functional, technical, operational, and legal dimensions:
- Guidelines for the functionality of common services are presented as well as the definition, processes, and services of specific roles.
- Guidelines how to implement or use a technical artefact of the IDSA.
- Guidelines for the work and collaboration within data services.
- Guidelines for the legal basis in compliance with the regulatory environment to ensure trust and security.
IDSA Rulebook also has a [Github repository](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDSA-Rulebook), where issues can be created.

## Going Beyond the Basics: Exploring IDS Concepts in Depth
:arrow_forward:**IDS Glossary** - 
The [IDS Glossary](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-G/tree/main/Glossary) is a collection of definitions for key terms related to the International Data Spaces (IDS). It serves as a reference for understanding the fundamental concepts and vocabulary used in the IDS ecosystem.


:arrow_forward:**IDS Standard (DIN SPEC 27070)** – The DIN SPEC 27070 is a confidential document that specifies the technical requirements and the reference architecture of a Security Gateway for the exchange of industry data and services. Based on the principles of data sovereignty, the Security Gateway facilitates secure exchange of data and allows providing and using trustworthy data services. [Request access to the document here.](https://internationaldataspaces.org/din-spec-27070/) 


:arrow_forward:**IDSA, GAIA-X, DSBA (Data Spaces Business Alliance), DSSC (Data Spaces Support Centre)** -
