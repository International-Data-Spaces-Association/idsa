# How To Build Data Spaces?
### Welcome to The IDS Knowledge Base: Your Five-Step Approach to Building Data Spaces with Ease

## Introduction
Navigating the vast landscape of Data Spaces can be challenging due to the abundance of information and complexity of the topics.

Here, you'll find all the information you need to build data spaces, whether you're just starting or have some experience.

### Who is this guide for?
This guide is intended for anyone interested in building data space components or using existing ones to build data spaces. The guide offers links and references for more in-depth learning, making it easy to find what you're looking for, whether you're new to the world of data spaces or an experienced professional.
