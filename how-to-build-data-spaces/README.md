# How To Build Dataspaces?
### :dart: Welcome to The IDS Knowledge Base: Your Five-Step Approach to Building Dataspaces with Ease

## Introduction
Navigating the vast landscape of dataspaces can be challenging due to the abundance of information and complexity of the topics. The IDS Knowledge Base was created to simplify the learning experience and provide a structured, easy-to-follow guide for building data spaces or components. Here, you'll find all the information you need to build data spaces, whether you're just starting or have some experience.

### Who is this guide for?
This guide is intended for anyone interested in building dataspace components or using existing ones to build dataspaces. The guide offers links and references for more in-depth learning, making it easy to find what you're looking for, whether you're new to the world of data spaces or an experienced professional.

If you are looking for a particular asset, be sure to check out the rest of [IDSA's GitHub repository](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa), where you'll find all our open-source repositories in one place. If you're interested in engaging with the IDS ecosystem, visit the [Connect page on the IDSA Website](https://internationaldataspaces.org/connect/) to learn more about the working groups, latest developments, and opportunities to collaborate.

## Your Five-Step Guide to Building Dataspaces
