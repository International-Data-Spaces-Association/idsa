# Contributing to IDSA Github

This is the official repository of [IDSA](https://www.internationaldataspaces.org) to provide a general overview of what is available on the IDS Open Source Landscape.

All content published here is provided and approved by the IDSA Head Office. You are very welcome to contribute to this repository when you find a bug, want to suggest an improvement, or have an idea for a useful feature. For this, always create an issue and a corresponding branch, and follow our style guides as described below.

Please note that we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that all contributors should stick to.

## Contributing to the IDSA knowledge base

Next to the general contribution guidelines in this document, you might want to continue with the [contribution guidelines for the knowledge base](./documentation/CONTRIBUTING.md) . The IDSA knowledge base is a community endeavor and you are invited to contribute.


## Issues

You always have to create an issue if you want to propose a correction, improvement, or feature.
Briefly and clearly describe the purpose of your contribution in the corresponding issue.
The pre-defined [labels](#labels) improve the understanding of your intentions and help to follow
the scope of your changes.

**Bug Report**: As mentioned above, bug reports should be submitted as an issue. To give others
the chance to reproduce the error in order to find a solution as quickly as possible, the report
should at least include the following information:
* Description: What did you expect and what happened instead?
* Steps to reproduce (system specs included)
* Relevant logs and/or media (optional): e.g. an image

## Labels


The [labels](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/labels) are listed at the
[issues](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/issues).
There are two types of labels: one describes the content of the issue and should be used by the
developer that creates the issue. The other one, starting with `status`, will be added from the
developer that takes on the issue. New issues should be initially marked with `status:open`.
*  Basic labels: `bug`, `documentation` `duplicate`, `enhancement`, `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `invalid`, `question`, `wontfix`
*  `bug`: Something isn't working
*  `documentation`: Improvements or additions to documentation
*  `duplicate`: This issue or pull request already exists
*  `enhancement`: New feature or request
*  `good first issue`: Good for newcomers
*  `help wanted`: Extra attention is needed
*  `invalid`: This doesn't seem right
*  `question`: Further information is requested
*  `wontfix`: This will not be worked on


## Branches

After creating an issue yourself or if you want to address an existing issue, you have to create a
branch with a unique number and name that assigns it to an issue. Therefore, follow the guidelines
at https://deepsource.io/blog/git-branch-naming-conventions/. After your changes, update the
`README.md`, Wiki, and `CHANGELOG.md` with necessary details. Then, create a pull request and note
that **committing to the main branch is not allowed**. Please use the feature `linked issues` to
link issues and pull requests.

Pull requests have to be approved by the IDSA Head Office.

## Commits

We encourage all contributors to stick to the commit convention following the specification on
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). In general, use  the
imperative in the present tense. A quick overview of the schema:
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]
```

Types: `fix`, `feat`, `chore`, `test`, `refactor`, `docs`, `release`. Append `!` for breaking
changes to a type.

An example of a very good commit might look like this: `feat![login]: add awesome breaking feature`


## Versioning
IDSA uses the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for versioning. The release versions
are tagged with their respective version.
