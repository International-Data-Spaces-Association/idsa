##IP Policy
(a) Any project that is added to the IDSA must have ownership of its trademark and logo assets.
(b) Each project shall determine whether it will require use of an approved IDSA CLA. For projects that select to use a CLA, all code contributors will undertake the obligations set forth in the Apache contributor license agreement(s), altered only as necessary to identify IDSA as the recipient of the contributions, and which shall be approved by the Governance Board. See CNCF Contributor License Agreements available at https://github.com/cncf/cla. The process for managing contributions in accordance with this policy shall be subject to Governance Board approval.
(c) All new inbound code contributions to the IDSA shall be (i) accompanied by a Develop-er Certificate of Origin sign-off (https://developercertificate.org) and (ii) made under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (available at https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), such license to be in addition to, and shall not supersede, obligations undertaken under the contribution license agreement(s) provided for in (b) above.
(d) All outbound code will be made available under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
(e) All projects evaluated for inclusion in the IDSA shall be completely licensed under an OSI-approved open source license. If the license for a project included in IDSA is not Apache License, Version 2.0, approval of the TSC shall be required.
(f) All documentation will be received and made available by the project under the Crea-tive Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
(g) If an alternative inbound or outbound license is required for compliance with the li-cense for a leveraged open source project or is otherwise required to achieve the IDSA mission, the TSC may approve the use of an alternative license for inbound or outbound contributions on an exception basis.
