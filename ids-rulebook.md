# IDS Rulebook

The IDSA rulebook serves several purposes regarding the development and operation of data spaces. The aim is to describe clearly which rules are mandatory and which are optional guidelines. This governance framework includes functional, technical, operational, and legal dimensions:

* Guidelines for the functionality of common services are presented as well as the definition, processes, and services of specific roles.
* Guidelines how to implement or use a technical artefact of the IDSA.
* Guidelines for the work and collaboration within data services.
* Guidelines for the legal basis in compliance with the regulatory environment to ensure trust and security.
